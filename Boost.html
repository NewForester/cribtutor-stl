<h1> Boost </h1>

<p>
Boost is a large and diverse collection of open source libraries that extend the STL.
It is not part of the STL and is beyond the scope of this tutorial.
</p>


<h2> Boost Libraries </h2>

<p>
Here are listed a number of Boost libraries that may well have been included in C++ 11.
<ol><li>
The <b>array&lt;&gt;</b> class template is a fixed size array that meets most of
the requirements for a sequence container.
</li>
<li>
The <b>dynamic_bitset&lt;&gt;</b> class template is similar to the STL bitset&lt;&gt;
but its size can change at run-time.
</li>
<li>
The <b>binder</b> library generalises the STL bind1st&lt;&gt; and bind2nd&lt;&gt;
function templates and adds place-holders.
</li>
<li>
The <b>compose</b> library allows multiple functors to be combined into a single functor
for use with STL algorithms.
</li>
<li>
Boost generalises the STL <b>functor adaptors</b> &apos;mem_fun&apos; etc.
</li>
<li>
The <b>function</b> library provides a generic function wrapper library.
</li>
<li>
There is an alternative &lt;functional&gt; header file
that avoids the reference-to-a-reference issue.
</li>
<li>
There is a <b>lamba function</b> library that provides an alternative to the use of binders, composers and adaptors
and offers features of functional programming.
</li>
<li>
There are several <b>smart pointer</b> libraries that provide solutions to a number of problems with the STL auto_ptr&lt;&gt;.
</li></ol>
