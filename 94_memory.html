<h1> STL Utilities </h1>


<h2> New and Delete </h2>

<p>
New and delete are the C++ equivalents of the malloc() and free() of C.
They are used to allocate and release heap memory but there the equivalence ends.
</p>

<p>
First, new and delete are C++ expressions.
For a <em>new</em> expression, the compiler generates a call to &apos;operator new&apos; to allocate memory and then calls a constructor to initialise it.
For a <em>delete</em> expression, the compiler generates a call to a destructor and then to &apos;operator delete&apos; to deallocate the memory.
</p>

<p>
There are different forms of the new and delete expressions for arrays.
These call <em>operator new[]</em> and <em>operator delete[]</em> and memory is initialised by
calling the default constructor many times over.
</p>

<p>
This is adequate for most purposes.  Alternatives are for advanced use only and require the inclusion of the &lt;<em>new</em>&gt; header file.
This represent lower level memory management.
For higher level memory management see the &lt;memory&gt; header file.
</p>

<p>
In the C++ 98 standard, there are three version of operator new:
<ol><!-- Shuffle List -->
<li><em>default</em> new    - which may throw bad_alloc</li>
<li><em>no throw</em> new   - which returns 0 instead of throwing an exception</li>
<li><em>placement</em> new  - which does not allocate memory but must be passed (at least) a pointer to the memory to be initialised</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
Although available for <em>application</em> use through new expressions, all exist to support the C++ run-time.
The STL, in particular, uses placement new.
There are corresponding delete operators but delete expressions always use the <em>default</em> operator delete.
</p>

<p>
The header file defines the <em>nothrow</em> constant that must be passed to the no throw version of operator new.
</p>

<p>
All six routines are in the <em>global</em> namespace, not the std namespace.
They are <em>replaceable</em>:  the application can implement its own routines.
They may be <em>overridden</em> within classes.
</p>

<p>
When operator new fails to allocate memory, it calls the <em>new handler</em> to allocate more system memory.
It is the new handler that should throw <em>bad_alloc</em> to indicate failure.
</p>

<p>
The application may install its own new handler by calling <em>set_new_handler</em>().
This routine returns the current handler so that it can be reinstalled if appropriate.
The application&apos;s handler must be of type <em>new_handler</em>.
</p>


<h2> Higher Level Memory Management </h2>

<p>
Lower level memory management comprises declarations for operator new and operator delete.
Higher level memory management comprises declarations for:
<ol>
<li>- allocators</li>
<li>- smart pointers</li>
<li>- uninitialised storage (described in section 3.7 Other Algorithms)</li>
</ol>
<!-- C++ 11 greatly expands on this -->
</p>


<h3> Allocators </h3>

<p>
An allocator&lt;&gt; class template is an abstraction of
<em>new</em> and <em>delete</em> expressions.
</p>

<p>
<em>Containers</em> use an allocator
to allocate/free memory and construct/destroy objects.
</p>

<p>
The STL provides a default allocator that uses the <em>global</em> new() and delete().
It uses the <em>placement</em> variant of new.
</p>

<p>
The default allocator is sufficient for most purposes.
Implementing custom allocators is a very advanced topic.
</p>

<p>
The <em>rebind</em>() method allows for
the allocation of a value-object wrapped in a container helper object.
This allows one allocation for a value-objects plus any overhead
such as a list node.
</p>


<h3> Smart Pointers </h3>

<p>
The auto_ptr&lt;&gt; class template implements a smart pointer for strict ownership of pointers.
</p>

<p>
Copying an auto_ptr object transfers the pointer <em>ownership</em>.
</p><p>
The pointer is deleted when the owner goes out of scope.
Therefore only pointers returned by <em>operator new</em> can be owned.
</p>
<p>
These measures are intended to avoid <em>double</em> deletes and memory <em>leaks</em>.
</p>

<p>
The auto_ptr&lt;&gt; copy semantics mean the rvalue is modified.
Therefore auto_ptr does not have value <em>semantics</em>
and cannot be used in value-objects stored in STL <em>containers</em>.
</p>

<p>
Boost provides <em>shared_ptr</em>&lt;&gt; and other useful smart pointers.
</p>
<!--
<p>
C++ 11 <em>deprecates</em> auto_ptr&lt;&gt;, replacing it with <em>unique_ptr</em>&lt;&gt;.
C++ 17 removes auto_ptr&lt;&gt; from the STL.
</p>
