<h1> STL Introduction </h1>

<p>
STL stands for Standard Template Library.
The STL is to C++ as the standard library is to C.
</p>

<p>
The use of <em>templates</em> ensures the <em>STL</em> is <em>generic</em> enough
to work with application specific <em>classes</em>.
</p><p>
As a consequence the syntax is <em>not</em> easy to read until you get used to it.
This set of crib sheets concentrates on semantics
and avoids using too much nasty syntax.
</p>

<p>
The STL is large.
A tutorial is no substitute for <em>practical</em> experience
but these crib sheets and the cribtutor program will, it is hoped,
not only help you <em>learn</em> what the STL comprises
but also <em>retain</em> and <em>recall</em> what you have learnt effectively.
</p>

<p>
This tutorial does not cover C++ 11.
</p>

<p>
Good luck and emjoy !
