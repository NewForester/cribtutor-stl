<h1> STL Streams </h1>

<p>
STL streams provide C++ with the input/output operations to/from
<ul>
<li>console,</li>
<li>files and</li>
<li>strings.</li>
</ul>
</p>


<h2> Introduction </h2>

<p>
The STL provides input and output via streams.
A stream is a channel through which data is transmitted.
</p>

<p>
One end is attached to the <em>program</em> which can read and/or write to the stream
and the other end to a <em>device</em>, a <em>file</em> or a string <em>buffer</em>.
</p>
<p>
For an <em>input</em> device such as a keyboard, the stream is attached to its <em>source</em>.
For an <em>output</em> device such as a display, the stream is bound to its <em>destination</em>.
</p>
<p>
Typically, at the lowest level, a stream deals with <em>characters</em> but at the highest level it deals with <em>C++ values</em>.
It converts between them.
</p>

<p>
There are three standard streams available to all programs:  <em>cin</em>, <em>cout</em> and <em>cerr</em>.
</p>
<p>
There is also <em>clog</em>, which is a buffered version of <em>cerr</em>.
There are wide character versions of all four.
</p>

<p>
Presumably, stream i/o could be used with any character or block device but how
a stream is associated with an arbitrary device is an advanced topic.
</p>


<h3> The STL input/output library </h3>

The STL input/output library has a class hierarchy split over a number of header files.

<p>
For i/o streams there are three header files:
<ol><!-- Shuffle List -->
<li>&lt;<em>istream</em>&gt;    – for input streams</li>
<li>&lt;<em>ostream</em>&gt;    – for output streams</li>
<li>&lt;<em>iostream</em>&gt;   – for input and output streams</li>
</ol>
The last effectively combines the first two.
</p>
<p>
For file and string streams there are two header files:
<ol><!-- Shuffle List -->
<li>&lt;<em>fstream</em>&gt;    – for file streams</li>
<li>&lt;<em>sstream</em>&gt;    – for string streams</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
There are two other header files of interest:
<ol><!-- Shuffle List -->
<li>&lt;<em>ios</em>&gt;        – for stream flags and such</li>
<li>&lt;<em>iomanip</em>&gt;    – for stream manipulators</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
There are three classes for i/o streams:
<ol><!-- Shuffle List -->
<li><em>istream</em>    – for input (provides extraction operators)</li>
<li><em>ostream</em>    – for output (provides insertion operators)</li>
<li><em>iostream</em>   – combines istream and ostream</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
There are three classes for file streams that inherit from the i/o stream classes:
<ol><!-- Shuffle List -->
<li><em>ifstream</em>   – for input from files</li>
<li><em>ofstream</em>   – for output to files</li>
<li><em>fstream</em>    – for file input and output</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
There are three classes for string streams that inherit from the i/o stream classes:
<ol><!-- Shuffle List -->
<li><em>istringstream</em>   – for extraction from strings</li>
<li><em>ostringstream</em>   – for insertion into strings</li>
<li><em>stringstream</em>    – effectively combines the other two</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
All methods and operators are in the <em>std</em> namespace.
</p>
<p>
Underneath are the classes <em>ios</em> and <em>ios_base</em>
that provide definitions for stream and formatting state flags, file open modes and other constants.
Many of their members (such as ios::failure and ios_base::failure) are interchangeable.
</p>
<p>
The provision of these definitions and the methods that rely on them at the lowest level
means everything is available when you need it but also provides scope for some confusion.
It is possible to open an ifstream for output although this serves no purpose.
The seekg() methods is available for ostream objects but, again, is of no practical use.
