cribtutor crib sheets for C++ Standard Template Library

----

This repository will contain crib sheets for the C++ Standard Template Library written during the development of the _cribtutor_ program itself.

Material will be added to the repository piecemeal as it is reviewed and cleaned up.

It is a separate repository because the author believes the program software and the these crib-sheet
should be released under different open source licences.

----

The STL crib-sheet, in terms of format and contents, are the author&apos;s own work.
The assertions in the crib-sheets are ultimately restatements of those in the C++ 98 standard.

Checking the assertions, among other things, did involve consulting several references, but not the standard itself.
None of these references admitted to being derived works.
