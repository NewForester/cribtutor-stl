# cribtutor-stl
_[cribtutor](https://github.com/NewForester/cribtutor)_ crib-sheets for the C++ Standard Template Library

----

These crib-sheets cover the C++ 98 Standard Template Library.
It does not cover later standards although they are mentioned in places.

----

Prerequisites:

  *  [cribtutor](https://github.com/NewForester/cribtutor)

The simplest form of installation is to:

  * download and build cribtutor (the latest 1.x.y release)
  * in the directory containing the cribtutor program create a directory named 'stl'
  * download and unpack the zip or tar archive of the cribtutor-stl release into the 'stl' subdirectory.

In the directory containing the cribtutor program, run:

    ./cribtutor stl

to get started.

----

These crib-sheets were written during the development of the cribtutor program.

They are in a separate repository because crib-sheets should be released under different
open source licence than that used for the program software.

----

In terms of format and contents, the crib-sheets are the author&apos;s own work.
The assertions in the crib-sheets are ultimately restatements of those in the C++ 98 standard.

Checking the assertions, among other things, did involve consulting several references, but not the standard itself.
None of these references admitted to being derived works.
